I am a final year PhD candicate in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Pragya Sur](https://sites.harvard.edu/prs499/). I received my Bachelors degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).

My early research work focuses on high dimensional statistics, specifically proportional asymptotics. I am recently interested in deep generative models. 

I am the president of [Lanke](https://lanke.fun/), a Chinese werewolf (board game) club.
